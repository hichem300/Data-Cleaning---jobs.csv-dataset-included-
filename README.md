In this project, we will be exploring and cleaning a dataset (jobs.csv) containing information on the completion of various types of work on apartments and houses (repairs, modifications, etc.) of individuals. 

The existing data contains various errors of different types. Some errors are easy to spot, even visually (for example, having dates in the wrong format or having dates and times in some places and only dates in others, and so on). 

Based on the discussions we have had in class, you are required to write code that finds and reports these problems. Some of the problems may be checked for all columns (for example, missing values), while others are specific to a column and depend on the type of data involved.

Note : I tried and cleaned the dataset but it's not optimized, you are welcome to try and do it as a practice, the dataset is included !
